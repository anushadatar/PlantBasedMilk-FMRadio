# Plant Based Milk - FM Radio
## Lauren Anfenson and Anusha Datar
Analog and Digital Communications FA19 Project 1 : FM Radio Receiver

## Summary
We wrote this code to create two different simple FM receivers using the [RTL2832U](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/) receiver. We collected a small sample of data from NPR, which happened to be about plant based milk, and decoded it using both an [envelope detector](https://github.com/anushadatar/PlantBasedMilk-FMRadio/blob/master/Exercise1-InPhaseData.m) and [I/Q data](https://github.com/anushadatar/PlantBasedMilk-FMRadio/blob/master/Exercise2-IQData.m) approach. 

We uploaded ou results to soundcloud [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-674765397/exercise1-audio-2) for the first approach and [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-674765397/exercise2-audio) for the second, and we also wrote a lab report with some derivations and plots [here](https://github.com/anushadatar/PlantBasedMilk-FMRadio/blob/master/Anfenson_Datar_FM_Lab.pdf).
